# MIS-310-IA-6

This script contains two separate problems that both work with lists and basic numeric analysis using user input.

In Problem 1 (Max sales), the program asks the user to enter sales figures for each weekday (Monday through Friday). These values are stored in a list. The script then loops through the list to find the maximum sales value and the corresponding day of the week. Finally, it prints out the maximum sales amount and the day on which it occurred using formatted f-strings.

In Problem 2 (Range of a list of numbers), the program repeatedly prompts the user to enter numeric values and adds each nonzero value to a list. Entering 0 ends the input. Once the list is complete, the script displays the list, finds the highest and lowest values by iterating through it, and then calculates the range as highest minus lowest. The computed range is printed as the final result. This part demonstrates list building with a loop, manual min/max search, and basic range calculation.
